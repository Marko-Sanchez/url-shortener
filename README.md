## Description
Program converts a long URL (original) to a shorter url. Using MongoDB atlas, we are able to request long url's given a key or convert url from long to short. Two programs are available a single thread ( main ) and multi-threaded program, either can be selected to run the pogram with. 
## Installation and Running
To be able to run the program; The first step is installing a mongoc c driver. After installation, the database type used in this project is MongoDB Atlas.  <br />
Creating an account is necessary to access the DB, after fallowing the process outlined in the tutorial obtain you API key and input into Macro.  <br />
` #define API_KEY <string> `  <br />
Finally, in your terminal runing make, will create an executible ./url-shortener, prompting you to enter desired command.  <br />
Commands: 
* Insertion: -i 'string'
* Query: -q 'string' 
<br />
You can dwell into the source code to be able to insert and query into your desired Collection.  <br />

**In Summary:**
1. Install mongoc driver.
2. Make an account on MongoDB.
3. after cloning, execute make.
4. Run desired commands
<br />
<b>Note:</b>
The single threaded program can be run simply by changing the name of it to url-shortner.c, while changing the multi-threaded program name to something else. Also
the single threaded version uses [ getopt ](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getopt.3.html) which is a linux based function, Although this can be changed to work without being on a linux system using if-statements.  <br />
